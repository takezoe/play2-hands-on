## What's this?

This is a hands-on training material to know how you can create a simple web application using Play2 + ScalikeJDBC.

The goal of this training is:

* First touch to Scala
* Create tiny web application in few hours

So we don't much explain about features of Scala languages and each framework deeply.
We achieve above goal using only basic knowledge of Scala, Play and ScalikeJDBC.

## Target Frameworks and Versions

* Play 2.6.x
* ScalikeJDBC 3.2.x

## Prerequisite

* Basic knowledge about Java and Web application development
* JDK 1.8 installation
* The latest version of IntelliJ IDEA installation

## Overview

We create a tiny CRUD application that manages user information having following features:

* List all users
* Register new user
* Modify user
* Delete user
